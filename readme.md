## Pricing Rules

I tried to make the pricin rules as flexible as possible.

So I implemented some expressions to make this work.

You have mostly two types:

* Deal 
* Discount

So in the rule field, for *Deals* you can type:

X FOR Y

EX: 
3 for 2
or 
2 for 1


For *Discounts* you can specify:

199.00

or

199.00 WHEN_THERE 3
